## Purpose
This project was a technical prototype to develop a 3D off-road driving simulator that includes the following features:

1. Physics-based Car Movement
2. 3D Terrain & Obstacles
3. Checkpoints
4. Player Health
5. Camera Control
6. User Interface
7. Analytics

## Framework
There is no framework for this project rather, collaboratively, students must create the project from scratch with the asset packs provided by Kenny.NL (https://kenney.nl/) under a Creative Commons 1.0 Universal License. 

## Features
### 1. Physics-based Car Movement
The vehicle should simulate realistic behaviours and be affected by the various physics forces like drag and gravity.

### 2. 3D Terrain & Obstacles

The player should be allowed to navigate a customised terrain and experience collisions when colliding with terrain features.

3. Checkpoints

The player is required to traverse a series of checkpoints in a specific order and should be indicated with a glow.

4. Player Health

The player should take damage when colliding with obstacles proportionate to the force of the collision and should exhibit different health states using values and particles.

5. Camera Control

The camera should follow the car and transition between stationary, accelerating and reversing.

6. User Interface (UI)

The game should have a health bar, timer, panel for when the player wins or loses and a button to allow players to restart.

7. Analytics

The game should record a set of events using Unity Analytics.

## Documentation
The project should include the following documentations
- Entity Relation Diagram
- Quality Assurance Plan
- Bug History
- Task Allocation
